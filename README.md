# decred_task1
a simple website in GoLang that allows for a user to create a new account and to login. Password should be securely stored using bcrypt and salted.

 For a next commit, when the user is logged in you can let them edit their profile. Let them set a Name, Email, Telegram, Skype, WhatsApp, Signal. All fields are optional. Also have them be able to change their password. Another thing, create an invite link, from the users profile page it shows their invite link and they can give it to other users. When someone signs up via invite link the user referral is saved. Adding new used should also save a created date.
